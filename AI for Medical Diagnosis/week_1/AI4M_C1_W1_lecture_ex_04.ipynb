    "Patient overlap in medical data is a part of a more general problem in machine learning called **data leakage**.  To identify patient overlap in this week's graded assignment, you'll check to see if a patient's ID appears in both the training set and the test set. You should also verify that you don't have patient overlap in the training and validation sets, which is what you'll do here.\n",
