# Create the series of countries: countries
countries = gapminder.country

# Drop all the duplicates from countries
countries = countries.drop_duplicates()

# Write the regular expression: pattern
pattern = '^[A-Za-z\.\s]*$'

# Create the Boolean vector: mask
mask = countries.str.contains(pattern)

# Invert the mask: mask_inverse
mask_inverse = ~mask

# Subset countries using mask_inverse: invalid_countries
invalid_countries = countries.loc[mask_inverse]

# Print invalid_countries
print(invalid_countries)

è¨»:- str.contains() - which takes a regular expression pattern, and applies it to the Series, 
returning True if there is a match, and False otherwise.

Since here you want to find the values that do not match, you have to invert the boolean, which can be done using ~. 
This Boolean series can then be used to get the Series of countries that have invalid names.
