In distance-based classification, for instance, 
we need to normalize eache feature value of a feature vector 
in order to not be affected more by features with wider range of possible values when computing distances.
If a feature has range in [-1,1] and another feature has range in [-100; 100], 
a small variation in the feature 2 is probably more influencing than a big variation in feature 1 
when computing the distance of two feature vectors.
