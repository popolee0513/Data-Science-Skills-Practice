In distance-based classification, for instance, 
we need to normalize eache feature value of a feature vector 
in order to not be affected more by features with wider range of possible values when computing distances.
For example
If a feature has range in [-1,1] and another feature has range in [-100; 100], 
a small variation in the feature 2 is probably more influencing than a big variation in feature 1 
when computing the distance of two feature vectors.

Decision Tree
tree 越往下長> 被越來越少數的training data 來support 
那些判斷式是根據比較少數的traing data 所學習得來
一個 node is backed by less training data > low confidence(不見得會apply 到不同 traing data)
                                          >  比較無法generalize 到 testing data
