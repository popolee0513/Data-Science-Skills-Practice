    "## **Predicting Movie Ratings**\n",
    "#### One of the most common uses of big data is to predict what users want.  This allows Google to show you relevant ads, Amazon to recommend relevant products, and Netflix to recommend movies that you might like.  This lab will demonstrate how we can use Apache Spark to recommend movies to a user.  We will start with some basic techniques, and then use the [Spark MLlib][mllib] library's Alternating Least Squares method to make more sophisticated predictions.\n",
    "#### For this lab, we will use a subset dataset of 500,000 ratings we have included for you into your VM (and on Databricks) from the [movielens 10M stable benchmark rating dataset](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). However, the same code you write will work for the full dataset, or their latest dataset of 21 million ratings.\n",

    "#### *Part 3*: Predictions for Yourself\n",
    "#### As mentioned during the first Learning Spark lab, think carefully before calling `collect()` on any datasets.  When you are using a small dataset, calling `collect()` and then using Python to get a sense for the data locally (in the driver program) will work fine, but this will not work when you are using a large dataset that doesn't fit in memory on one machine.  Solutions that call `collect()` and do local analysis that could have been done with Spark will likely fail in the autograder and not receive full credit.\n",

Spark also exposes some higher level functionality; in particular, Machine Learning using a component of Spark called [MLlib][mllib].  In this part, you will learn how to use MLlib to make personalized movie recommendations using the movie data we have been analyzing.\n",
    "#### We are going to use a technique called [collaborative filtering][collab]. Collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue x than to have the opinion on x of a person chosen randomly. You can read more about collaborative filtering [here][collab2].\n",
    "#### The image below (from [Wikipedia][collab]) shows an example of predicting of the user's rating using collaborative filtering. At first, people rate different items (like videos, images, games). After that, the system is making predictions about a user's rating for an item, which the user has not rated yet. These predictions are built upon the existing ratings of other users, who have similar ratings with the active user. For instance, in the image below the system has made a prediction, that the active user will not like the video.\n",

    "#### Since not all users have rated all movies, we do not know all of the entries in this matrix, which is precisely why we need collaborative filtering.  For each user, we have ratings for only a subset of the movies.  With collaborative filtering, the idea is to approximate the ratings matrix by factorizing it as the product of two matrices: one that describes properties of each user (shown in green), and one that describes properties of each movie (shown in blue).\n",

    "#### We want to select these two matrices such that the error for the users/movie pairs where we know the correct ratings is minimized.  The [Alternating Least Squares][als] algorithm does this by first randomly filling the users matrix with values and then optimizing the value of the movies such that the error is minimized.  Then, it holds the movies matrix constrant and optimizes the value of the user's matrix.  This alternation between which matrix to optimize is the reason for the \"alternating\" in the name.\n",
    "#### This optimization is what's being shown on the right in the image above.  Given a fixed set of user factors (i.e., values in the users matrix), we use the known ratings to find the best values for the movie factors using the optimization written at the bottom of the figure.  Then we \"alternate\" and pick the best user factors given fixed movie factors.\n",

    "#### **(2b) Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**\n",
    "#### In the next part, you will generate a few different models, and will need a way to decide which model is best. We will use the [Root Mean Square Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation) (RMSE) or Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) to compute the error of each model.  RMSE is a frequently used measure of the differences between values (sample and population values) predicted by a model or an estimator and the values actually observed. The RMSD represents the sample standard deviation of the differences between predicted values and observed values. These individual differences are called residuals when the calculations are performed over the data sample that was used for estimation, and are called prediction errors when computed out-of-sample. The RMSE serves to aggregate the magnitudes of the errors in predictions for various times into a single measure of predictive power. RMSE is a good measure of accuracy, but only to compare forecasting errors of different models for a particular variable and not between variables, as it is scale-dependent.\n",
    "####  The RMSE is the square root of the average value of the square of `(actual rating - predicted rating)` for all users and movies for which we have the actual rating. Versions of Spark MLlib beginning with Spark 1.4 include a [RegressionMetrics](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.mllib.html#pyspark.mllib.evaluation.RegressionMetrics) modiule that can be used to compute the RMSE. However, since we are using Spark 1.3.1, we will write our own function.\n",
    "#### Write a function to compute the sum of squared error given `predictedRDD` and `actualRDD` RDDs. Both RDDs consist of tuples of the form (UserID, MovieID, Rating)\n",
    "#### Given two ratings RDDs, *x* and *y* of size *n*, we define RSME as follows: $ RMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2}{n}}$\n",
    "#### To calculate RSME, the steps you should perform are:\n",
    "* #### Transform `predictedRDD` into the tuples of the form ((UserID, MovieID), Rating). For example, tuples like `[((1, 1), 5), ((1, 2), 3), ((1, 3), 4), ((2, 1), 3), ((2, 2), 2), ((2, 3), 4)]`. You can perform this step with a single Spark transformation.\n",

    "* #### Using only RDD transformations (you only need to perform two transformations), compute the squared error for each *matching* entry (i.e., the same (UserID, MovieID) in each RDD) in the reformatted RDDs - do *not* use `collect()` to perform this step. Note that not every (UserID, MovieID) pair will appear in both RDDs - if a pair does not appear in both RDDs, then it does not contribute to the RMSE. You will end up with an RDD with entries of the form $ (x_i - y_i)^2$ You might want to check out Python's [math](https://docs.python.org/2/library/math.html) module to see how to compute these values\n",
    "* #### Using an RDD action (but **not** `collect()`), compute the total squared error: $ SE = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2 $\n",
    "* #### Compute *n* by using an RDD action (but **not** `collect()`), to count the number of pairs for which you computed the total squared error\n",
    "* #### Using the total squared error and the number of pairs, compute the RSME. Make sure you compute this value as a [float](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-long-complex).\n",

ALS takes a training dataset (RDD) and several parameters that control the model creation process. To determine the best values for the parameters, we will use ALS to train several models, and then we will select the best model and use the parameters from that model in the rest of this lab exercise.\n",
    "#### The process we will use for determining the best model is as follows:\n",
    "* #### Pick a set of model parameters. The most important parameter to `ALS.train()` is the *rank*, which is the number of rows in the Users matrix (green in the diagram above) or the number of columns in the Movies matrix (blue in the diagram above). (In general, a lower rank will mean higher error on the training dataset, but a high rank may lead to [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting).)  We will train models with ranks of 4, 8, and 12 using the `trainingRDD` dataset.\n",
    "* #### Create a model using `ALS.train(trainingRDD, rank, seed=seed, iterations=iterations, lambda_=regularizationParameter)` with three parameters: an RDD consisting of tuples of the form (UserID, MovieID, rating) used to train the model, an integer rank (4, 8, or 12), a number of iterations to execute (we will use 5 for the `iterations` parameter), and a regularization coefficient (we will use 0.1 for the `regularizationParameter`).\n",
    "* #### For the prediction step, create an input RDD, `validationForPredictRDD`, consisting of (UserID, MovieID) pairs that you extract from `validationRDD`. You will end up with an RDD of the form: `[(1, 1287), (1, 594), (1, 1270)]`\n",
    "* #### Using the model and `validationForPredictRDD`, we can predict rating values by calling [model.predictAll()](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.mllib.html#pyspark.mllib.recommendation.MatrixFactorizationModel.predictAll) with the `validationForPredictRDD` dataset, where `model` is the model we generated with ALS.train().  `predictAll` accepts an RDD with each entry in the format (userID, movieID) and outputs an RDD with each entry in the format (userID, movieID, rating).\n",
    "* #### Evaluate the quality of the model by using the `computeError()` function you wrote in part (2b) to compute the error between the predicted ratings and the actual ratings in `validationRDD`.\n",
    "####  Which rank produces the best model, based on the RMSE with the `validationRDD` dataset?\n",
    "#### Note: It is likely that this operation will take a noticeable amount of time (around a minute in our VM); you can observe its progress on the [Spark Web UI](http://localhost:4040). Probably most of the time will be spent running your `computeError()` function, since, unlike the Spark ALS implementation (and the Spark 1.4 [RegressionMetrics](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.mllib.html#pyspark.mllib.evaluation.RegressionMetrics) module), this does not use a fast linear algebra library and needs to run some Python code for all 100k entries."
