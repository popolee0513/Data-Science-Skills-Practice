Weights give us a way to specify which tokens to favor. With weights, when we compare documents, instead of counting common tokens, we sum up the weights of common tokens. A good heuristic for assigning weights is called \"Term-Frequency/Inverse-Document-Frequency,\" or [TF-IDF][tfidf] for short.\n","#### **TF**\n","#### TF rewards tokens that appear many times in the same document.

We call these weights *local* weights.  TF is an example of a local weight, because it depends on the length of the source.  On the other hand, some token weights only depend on the token, and are the same everywhere that token is found.  We call these weights *global*, and IDF is one such weight.\n","#### **TF-IDF**\n","#### Finally, to bring it all together, the total TF-IDF weight for a token in a document is the product of its TF and IDF weights.\n","[tfidf]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RJaLQZmDtVx7"},"source":["### **(2a) Implement a TF function**\n","#### Implement `tf(tokens)` that takes a list of tokens and returns a Python [dictionary](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) mapping tokens to TF weights.\n","#### The steps your function should perform are:\n","* #### Create an empty Python dictionary\n","* #### For each of the tokens in the input `tokens` list, count 1 for each occurance and add the token to the dictionary\n","* #### For each of the tokens in the dictionary, divide the token's count by the total number of tokens in the input `tokens` list"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"_91pR8_KtVx7","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1630219229337,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":649,"user":{"displayName":"popo 0513","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ghr-2ai6kOB-nngy3XppgjADlqjQzsFNsjboPyAtQ=s64","userId":"00845571363212954307"}},"outputId":"cc08de8d-348f-46dd-9837-338568b5be86"},"source":["# TODO: Replace <FILL IN> with appropriate code\n","import numpy as np\n","def tf(tokens):\n","    \"\"\" Compute TF\n","    Args:\n","        tokens (list of str): input list of tokens from tokenize\n","    Returns:\n","        dictionary: a dictionary of tokens to its TF values\n","    \"\"\"\n","    count=dict()\n","    for i in tokens:\n","      if i not in count.keys():\n","        count[i]=1\n","      else:\n","        count[i]+=1\n"," \n","    for k, v in count.items():\n","        count[k] = v/len(tokens)\n","    return count\n","\n","print (tf(tokenize(quickbrownfox)))"],"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["{'quick': 0.16666666666666666, 'brown': 0.16666666666666666, 'fox': 0.16666666666666666, 'jumps': 0.16666666666666666, 'lazy': 0.16666666666666666, 'dog': 0.16666666666666666}\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"czuJOlmxtVx7","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1630219230161,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"popo 0513","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ghr-2ai6kOB-nngy3XppgjADlqjQzsFNsjboPyAtQ=s64","userId":"00845571363212954307"}},"outputId":"a61f0401-03ea-4bba-9577-2672f03cf3d5"},"source":["# TEST Implement a TF function (2a)\n","tf_test = tf(tokenize(quickbrownfox))\n","Test.assertEquals(tf_test, {'brown': 0.16666666666666666, 'lazy': 0.16666666666666666,\n","                             'jumps': 0.16666666666666666, 'fox': 0.16666666666666666,\n","                             'dog': 0.16666666666666666, 'quick': 0.16666666666666666},\n","                    'incorrect result for tf on sample text')\n","tf_test2 = tf(tokenize('one_ one_ two!'))\n","Test.assertEquals(tf_test2, {'one_': 0.6666666666666666, 'two': 0.3333333333333333},\n","                    'incorrect result for tf test')"],"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["1 test passed.\n","1 test passed.\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"czwLSmJTtVx7"},"source":["### **(2b) Create a corpus**\n","#### Create a pair RDD called `corpusRDD`, consisting of a combination of the two small datasets, `amazonRecToToken` and `googleRecToToken`.

The metric of string distance we will use is called **[cosine similarity][cosine]**. We will treat each document as a vector in some high dimensional space. Then, to compare two documents we compute the cosine of the angle between their two document vectors. This is *much* easier than it sounds.\n","#### The first question to answer is how do we represent documents as vectors? The answer is familiar: bag-of-words! We treat each unique token as a dimension, and treat token weights as magnitudes in their respective token dimensions. For example, suppose we use simple counts as weights, and we want to interpret the string \"Hello, world!  Goodbye, world!\" as a vector. Then in the \"hello\" and \"goodbye\" dimensions the vector has value 1, in the \"world\" dimension it has value 2, and it is zero in all other dimensions.\n","#### The next question is: given two vectors how do we find the cosine of the angle between them? Recall the formula for the dot product of two vectors:\n","#### $$ a \\cdot b = \\| a \\| \\| b \\| \\cos \\theta $$\n","#### Here $ a \\cdot b = \\sum a_i b_i $ is the ordinary dot product of two vectors, and $ \\|a\\| = \\sqrt{ \\sum a_i^2 } $ is the norm of $ a $.\n","#### We can rearrange terms and solve for the cosine to find it is simply the normalized dot product of the vectors. With our vector model, the dot product and norm computations are simple functions of the bag-of-words document representations, so we now have a formal way to compute similarity:\n","#### $$ similarity = \\cos \\theta = \\frac{a \\cdot b}{\\|a\\| \\|b\\|} = \\frac{\\sum a_i b_i}{\\sqrt{\\sum a_i^2} \\sqrt{\\sum b_i^2}} $$\n","#### Setting aside the algebra, the geometric interpretation is more intuitive. The angle between two document vectors is small if they share many tokens in common, because they are pointing in roughly the same direction. For that case, the cosine of the angle will be large. Otherwise, if the angle is large (and they have few words in common), the cosine is small.

Our implementation is limited by its quadratic run time complexity, and is not practical for even modestly sized datasets.  In this part, we will implement a more scalable algorithm and use it to do entity resolution on the full dataset.\n","### Inverted Indices\n","#### To improve our ER algorithm from the earlier parts, we should begin by analyzing its running time. In particular, the algorithm above is quadratic in two ways. First, we did a lot of redundant computation of tokens and weights, since each record was reprocessed every time it was compared. Second, we made quadratically many token comparisons between records.\n","#### The first source of quadratic overhead can be eliminated with precomputation and look-up tables, but the second source is a little more tricky. In the worst case, every token in every record in one dataset exists in every record in the other dataset, and therefore every token makes a non-zero contribution to the cosine similarity. In this case, token comparison is unavoidably quadratic.\n","#### But in reality most records have nothing (or very little) in common. Moreover, it is typical for a record in one dataset to have at most one duplicate record in the other dataset (this is the case assuming each dataset has been de-duplicated against itself). In this case, the output is linear in the size of the input and we can hope to achieve linear running time.\n","#### An [**inverted index**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) is a data structure that will allow us to avoid making quadratically many token comparisons.  It maps each token in the dataset to the list of documents that contain the token.  So, instead of comparing, record by record, each token to every other token to see if they match, we will use inverted indices to *look up* records that match on a particular token.\n","> #### **Note on terminology**: In text search, a *forward* index maps documents in a dataset to the tokens they contain.
